# Idea:
Glad to have you back! That hopefully means you liked the first DIP :). Today we're going ambitious. It's the second DIP ever, and I could talk about paper towels or pizza, but let's talk about **uncertainty**. I know, today's a strong one.

I like to think of uncertainty as a little monster—an ugly, somewhat mean, but lighthearted monster. Let's call him Un (short for Understanding uncertainty, obviously). Un is virtually everywhere, trying to make your life as unpredictable and chaotic as possible. "Finally finished that task you'd been trying for a year? You must be expecting a big rest now haha," says Un with an evil grin in his face, moments before breaking your computer. Great, now you don't have a project *and* a computer.

Sadly, Un gets like that sometimes. Like a little child, uncertainty is messy and unstable, and the mere fact of *not knowing* is frustrating. "What's the worst that could happen?" Honestly, I don't know, and that makes it even more scary (meta-Un right here). Not even knowing the worst possible scenario means basically *anything* can happen, and it is pretty scary. And no, there's no solution. No matter how rich you are, no matter how handsome or successful you become, a fucking meteorite can always fall on your roof (or lack thereof). No one escapes Un.

But I do think Un gets a bit too much hate sometimes. As I said, he's a monster, but a lighthearted one. Un can be mean, but he also manages to give us nice surprises. Think about that one day everything was going great **and** an unexpected, amazing event occurred. Thank Un. The point clear: uncertainty is a double-edged sword.

Now, let's talk about quite the opposite thing this DIP was supossed to be about (trust me on this one): routine. Routine is where Un disappears, a sense of predictability that gives us comfort and a feeling of control. Sure, it gets boring and monotonous, but, ask yourself, what do you prefer, an easy, boring life, or a chaotic adventure? The answer is obvious. Right?

Hopefully you thought "what this handsome man is saying ain't that obvious," because the truth is it's not an easy question. You may take some seconds now—or perhaps minutes, if you're feeling a little bit cheeky and inspired—to reflect on this: is your life predictable? Whatever the answer is, do you like that? You're not allowed to continue until you do this. (Okay that's a joke, but it might prove more useful than you think!).

Sometimes, we feel stuck. "What am I even doing with my life?" I know that sounds familiar—it does to everyone. Of course, being irrational and reckless is almost never going to yield positive results, but perhaps it's Un, the very being we started this reflection by hating on, that you're missing. Going out of your comfort zone—whether to you that means going to a different restaurant or starting a quest to master a new instrument you've picked up—is amazing. It's not necessary, though. You can live a full life under predictability. Study, have fun, go with friends, maybe get married, have kids—you know the deal. If that's something you're content with, that's perfectly valid! But some of us need Un there to give life that extra spice that truly makes it worth going through.

Uncertainty is overwhelming, but it makes us grow in unexpected ways. It's never too late to turn the dial slightly. Even if you think you can't, I guarantee you that you're in for a big surprise about your own capacities. If this DIP has shown you anything, I hope it is that it's worth it—that one thing you've always wanted to try, or perhaps that small idea that's been on your mind lately, give it a shot. And tell me how it goes! (If I'm not dead yet).

Comfort is cool, but I don't think it's how life should go. I encourage you, whoever you might be, to not fear Un. Instead, look at it in the eyes. Whether he's mad and trying to make your life a misery or is helping you, **embrace it**. Even in other contexts, like considering uncomfortable ideas, I suggest you give it a shot. It's difficult (and it'll always be), but digesting ideas like death or uncertainty is what helps us grow, and it's a big part of what DIP is about. Reading is a great first step, but why don't you write *your own* DIP? Just once. Not a mandatory exercise, but I invite you to consider the idea.

P.S. I'm feeling a bit uncertain on how to end this DIP, so I'll end it abruptly. I know it's weird but I think that-
