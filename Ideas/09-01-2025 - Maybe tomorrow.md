Hey, Dipper! (Get it?)

Let's talk about time. Random question, but what's the last time you felt truly happy, when you were fully at peace? I'm not sure I can quite remember that.

It's easy to take something important (exercise, sleep, socialize, or, well, feeling happy) and setting it off for later. "Uh, maybe tomorrow." Please refer to my DIP on when you're lying to yourself, because you are. Don't keep pushing it into the distance. You don't have to do it *now* per se, but it's a good habit to set up a date for it.

Break the cycle. Write down what you want to be doing (or what you *should* be doing) and ask yourself: "When will I do this?" Unless you're a rock-star, don't say "I don't have time." That's almost always (again) a lie.

As for me, this means waiting for a lot of things. I am the first one postponing crucial stuff farther down the line. But I know when I'll do it. Everything's planned. Of course, you don't need to be like me and plan ahead your wedding at 16 (hyperbole), but you *can* begin by setting some rough sketches of how you want your life (be it the next few weeks, months, or years) to look. If your life continues as it is know, will you be proud of yourself in 5 years?

It's "one day" or "day one," my friends. Which are you choosing?

P.S. "Taco cat" is "Taco cat" spelled backwards.
