# Idea:
The beginning of a new journey always feels strange. You get this feeling that you don't know if your journey will be long, or how it will end. It's funny, because you know there's a 50% chance this day is a monumental first moment that marks the beginning of a life-long project and a 50% chance it's a random Wednesday that becomes meaningless once the project fails in a week or two.

It's scary. It's risky. But notice: that's exactly why we see little projects succeeding. Of course, you miss 100% of the shots you don't make, and even though I'm terrible at hitting targets, I may hit one or two if I'm just vomiting darts around. And that's exactly what I'm doing with DIP. Will it work? Statistically, no. But I hold onto the little hope that reflections like this one—funny, beautiful, amazing, literally perfect, and, of course, humble—will make continuing the project worth it.

I mean, this almost feels like a letter to the future rather than a real reflection on an idea. Hey, future, did DIP work? You didn't notice it but that *was* a pretty interesting question. If you're reading it, it's likely it *did* work (why would anybody revisit a messy failed project? That's the neat part: they wouldn't). So, future readers, I can confidently said: DIP worked. Hooray! (Celebrate)

Who am I talking to? Well, uh, I don't know! And *that's the cool part*. The project may become a book shown to others about the thoughts of a random dude. It may become and important archive of self-reflection. To others? Just to me? **I have no idea**. Also, yes, I'm experimenting with these weird things of bolds and italics in markdown. Pretty cool!

I guess I should talk more about the idea itself. Be it DIP or anything else, starting a new journey is scary. But that's life. Thus, by the associative property (yes), life is scary. But, hey, by the I-despise-a-boring-life property some of us operate by (like me!), that also makes life pretty darn cool. Taking risks is always fun. Taking risks is always rewarding. Hell, I've dedicated my life for the past year to leaving my country and going to another continent to study. Absurd? Yes. Cool as hell? Absolutely. I don't know if it will work; I don't know how it'll be like if it does. Honestly, I don't even know if I'm gonna keep living there after studying. Only time will tell.

Today is a great day. First day of the year (though I'm lying: it's January 2nd. It's 2am though, so it's pretty much the same thing, huh?), first DIP, and a beautiful reflection on the nature of *starting*. Always the hardest step, yet the most memorable one. Reader, whoever you may be (could be my grandson, myself, or an Irish woman in the 2050s), I wish you luck in all your starts. I only ask for one thing back, and it's for you to wish me luck too. Don't you see how that would help? Oh god, this is about time paradoxes, like Steven Hawking's time travelers party. I can't invade the first DIP with an arbitrary, non-fundamental idea! I have to leave, goodbye readers! Start!
