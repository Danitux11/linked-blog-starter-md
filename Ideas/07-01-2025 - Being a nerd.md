# Idea:
Unironically, I've just put down a 380 page math book I was reading to write today's DIP. On top of that, tomorrow my winter break ends (sad.) and school's at it again, so we might as well talk about studying today.

I'm a nerd, and I love it. I've always hated the Spanish education system—not just the fact that it's so focused on memorization, but how it leads to competition and overall not a very productive learning experience. As a result, it's exceptionally rare to find students who would say the love learning (even if they *do* love it). The truth is, everyone is interested at some level on the topics shown in a classroom—some may like math, while others are interested by plants or planets, but it's undeniable that all of us have sometime, somehow, experienced the beauty of learning truly.

But why do we hate it? And, more importantly, what should we do? Great question, Daniel (me).

At school, learning is focused on memorizing content, vomiting it on a test, and forgetting it the next day. I'm sure it's the 300th time you read something along those lines, and I don't think repeating the whole thing is necessary. Unless you're up for dedicating substantial time and resources to make a meaningful change in the education system, your best bet to escape this madness is to learn *another way*. For some, it may be about finding a mentor, or perhaps mates they can learn with. But I never liked depending on others, especially on something as important as education, so let's talk about *my* method (and the method millions of other use): learning independently.

For me, I always liked math, but (like everyone else I've talked with) I **hate** the damn exercise sheets. Boring, repetitive, monotonous, and damn repetitive. I get chills from thinking about them. This apparent ambivalence towards the subject often made me wonder if I should truly pursue math, and it wasn't until I discovered that, well, I can learn on my own, that everything clicked into place. With the help of the internet, I've been able to learn independently about *anything and everything* and it's truly a game-changer. Even if you think you hate a subject, I promise you there's something in there that will make you think otherwise. Try to put to the side your current hate for it, and give it a shot. A *real* one. Of course, this approach lacks the really important part of having some kind of guidance, so you're going to need to be somewhat self-disciplined to pull it off. (Under no circumstance let a teacher read the above paragraph; it's classified information that remains between you and me).

If you're thinking "Oh! What a pleasant and beautiful DIP! I really wanna learn about X! How could I learn about X?" you're right to ask. Here are some approaches I've seen work for me (assuming you have no way of learning from someone else you personally know):

1. YouTube. Search "Learn X," or whatever, and a couple (hundred thousand) videos will appear. Cheers (though don't fall in the rabbit hole of watching yet not doing. Not worth it).
2. Reddit. The most academic and formal resource you'll find (irony): just search for the subreddit r/X and you'll find a place full of learners like you, perhaps filled with resources, guides, and a community that will answer any doubts you have.

Yeah, it doesn't get much deeper than that. Keep in mind, we're talking about learning *anything*. It doesn't have to be the most academic thing ever: playing an instrument, a board game, or cooking are all perfect examples of things you could be learning if you feel truly interested.

If you're feeling a little mischievous, perhaps you could try to convince some peers to give your learning subject a shot too—always better to have someone to support you on your journey. And if you're extra cheeky, you may join competitions or formal courses in the matter (outside of school; evident, right?).

At the end of the day, all that matters is you enjoy it. Yeah, I know, "learning isn't a chore"-sounding DIP, but it's true. A big part of what it takes to grow and develop as a person is to be open-minded, and being open to changing how you feel about learning or being a nerd is a great start. Perhaps I've convinced you, or perhaps you're laughing at the hilarious attempt I just made to drag you into the cult of people who actually enjoy learning. Forcing yourself to do it just for the sake of it may not be the best choice either; the best I can say right now is, give it a thought.

And if you're not sure where to start or what to even learn, [here](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown) you can find a good starting resource for math to get your feet wet. You're gonna love it. We'll end with a quote, so you learn I'm also a bit of a poet.
